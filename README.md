- `data/appointment_slots.json`: Generated live slot table used by the API.
- `data/settings.json`: Slot capacity, booking window, and slot times.

## Booking System

The appointment flow uses live server-backed slot availability.

- Available dates and times are loaded from the server.
- Each slot has a fixed capacity and locks when full.
- Bookings receive a confirmation code.
- Cancellations release the slot back into availability.
- Confirmation emails are sent when SMTP is configured.

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies with `npm.cmd install` on Windows.
2. Start the server with `node server.js` or `npm start`.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

Set these in a `.env` file to enable real email delivery:

- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_SECURE`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `MAIL_FROM`

Without those variables, booking and cancellation still work and email messages are generated through the test mailbox service.

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the system design, API endpoints, data model, and booking flow.
